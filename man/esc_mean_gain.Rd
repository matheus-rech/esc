\value{
The effect size \code{es}, the standard error \code{se}, the variance
        of the effect size \code{var}, the lower and upper confidence limits
        \code{ci.lo} and \code{ci.hi}, the weight factor \code{w} and the
        total sample size \code{totaln}.

\description{
Compute effect size from Mean Gain Scores and Standard
  Deviations for pre-post tests.
}
\details{
For this function, either the gain scores of mean and sd
  (\code{gain1mean} and \code{gain1sd} for the first group and
  \code{gain2mean} and \code{gain2sd} for the second group) must be
  specified, or the pre-post values (\code{pre1mean}, \code{post1mean},
  \code{pre1sd} and \code{post1sd} and the counterpart arguments for the
  second group).
  \cr \cr
  If the pre-post standard deviations are available, no correlation value
  \code{grp1r} resp. \code{grp2r} needs to be specified, because these can
  then be computed based on t-value computation. However, if \code{grp1r}
  is specified, this value will be used (and no t-test performed).
}
\note{
If \code{es.type = "r"}, Fisher's transformation for the effect size
  \code{r} and their confidence intervals are also returned.
